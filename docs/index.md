# Premade PHP Functions

Premade PHP Functions (PMPF) is a collection of functions that I have created in PHP that just make your life easier. I made new functions that I thought should have been in PHP, but weren't.



# Installation

To get started, download the [Premade PHP Functions Package](https://www.johnodon.com/resources/product.php?id=4&name=pmpf) from the Johnodon website. Unzip the folder somewhere in your website, and on the top of every page you want to have the custom functions on, include or require the `premadefunctions.php` at the top of the page.


# Usage

Examples of functions are on the [Johnodon website](https://www.johnodon.com/pmpf/). Once you have unzipped the folder and included it on your page, you are ready to use it. d
